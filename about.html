                            <p>Becoming a "Software Developer" was my dream since i was in 4th standard. I always used
                                to think "How i can create my own Website?" I still remember when i was in 5th standard,
                                my teacher asked about my dream. Obviously my answer was "Becoming a Software Developer"
                                But, my teacher answered with really heavy words "Being a software developer? U have to
                                study and be patient to become a software developer". My friends came and demotivated
                                me. After those things that happened to me I started feeling shy to tell anyone that my
                                dream is to become a Software Developer. In 6th standard my father was checking my
                                youtube history, It was full of those were related to Software Development. My father
                                figured out that I wanted to Become a Software developer. He talked to me that night and
                                I somehow expressed my dream towards him and my Father actually supported me. He Gifted
                                me a brand new pc for programming. In 7th standard I started learning 'Pyhthon' but I
                                messed up that time. Basically I quitted and I randomly started learning HTML without
                                learning css and I messed up again. But then a person named "Sundan" motivated me and
                                suggested me to learn HTML and css and Finally I was able to create this website.</p>
